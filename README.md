## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - JS Build Tool
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Styling
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en) - Server 

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development

As my skills in development continue to grow, I will also improve my portfolio to match. Recently I incorporated a more advanced navigation menu with a neat animated transition and tidied up my Tailwind styles. In the future, I would like to be able to create an animated landing page for a more exciting user experience, as well as a demonstration of my skills.


### Useful resources

- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This was my first project using Tailwind and their documentation support was vital on this project
